-- THE MANAGEMENT REPORTING AGGREGATE: revenue by financial year, by what was
-- sold, and by who bought it — now across BOTH selling systems.
--
-- This is the table `fct_daily_revenue` could not be. That one is day x country,
-- which answers "how are we trading" and nothing management accounting asks.
-- The axes here are the ones that appear on a P&L pack:
--
--   FISCAL PERIOD     from dim_date, on Contoso's 1 April financial year — so
--                     July trading reports as FY27 Q2, and the storefront sales
--                     that fall on 30 June once their UTC offsets are applied
--                     report as FY27 Q1. Two quarters, from one month of
--                     calendar trading, which is exactly why the fiscal
--                     calendar is not a relabelling of the calendar one.
--   PRODUCT SEGMENT   from the group data office's rollup, plus "Unallocated"
--                     for the SKUs the storefront sells that nobody published.
--   CUSTOMER SEGMENT  from the POS system, via the resolved party. NULL for
--                     web-only shoppers, reported as its own line rather than
--                     bucketed — see below.
--   CHANNEL SYSTEM    which business sold it. Kept because "revenue is up" and
--                     "online revenue is up" are different sentences.
--
-- NET IS THE HEADLINE. The storefront cancels about 5% of its orders and the
-- POS system has no such concept, so `revenue_usd` excludes cancellations and
-- `cancelled_revenue_usd` reports them alongside. A pack that showed only gross
-- would overstate the business by the cancellation rate; one that showed only
-- net would hide it. A singular test asserts the two still account for every
-- dollar in fct_sales.
--
-- LEFT JOIN TO THE PARTY, and this is the one that matters. `marketing_segment`
-- is NULL for the 18,000 people who have only ever shopped online, because only
-- the POS system segments customers. An inner join would have removed their
-- revenue from the pack entirely — a fifth of the customer base vanishing with
-- every subtotal still adding up correctly.
