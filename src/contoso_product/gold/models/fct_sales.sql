-- BOTH SELLING SYSTEMS, one grain, one currency.
--
-- This is the fact the reporting pack is built on. `fct_orders` remains the POS
-- system's own fact, keyed on its `customer_id` and pinned by the fixture
-- contract; this one is the unified view, keyed on the resolved `party_key` so
-- a shop sale and an online sale by the same person land on the same row of any
-- customer-level report.
--
-- LINE GRAIN, because that is the only grain both systems share. A POS order is
-- already one product; a storefront order is a basket, which silver flattened.
-- Reporting at order grain would mean either exploding one side or collapsing
-- the other, and collapsing loses the product.
--
-- CANCELLATIONS ARE CARRIED, NOT FILTERED. The storefront reports 5% of its
-- orders cancelled and the POS system has no such concept. Dropping them here
-- would make the number irrecoverable downstream; `is_cancelled` lets the pack
-- report net revenue as the headline and still show what was written off.
