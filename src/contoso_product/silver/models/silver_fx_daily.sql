-- FX rates CARRIED FORWARD to a dense daily calendar.
--
-- The vendor quotes on business days only -- 132 rows for 4 currencies over a
-- 47-day span, so weekends have no quote. A join on rate_date alone would drop
-- every weekend order silently, which is the failure this model exists to
-- prevent: the rate in force on Saturday is Friday's, and `rate_is_carried`
-- says so rather than leaving the reader to infer it.
